# Vendor-Reset-Tracker
Tracks when money resets for NPC vendors in Project-Gorgon


Have only start and reset button
when start is clicked always pop modal with inputs for days hours minutes and seconds


also maybe better UI would be something like: Add button -> list of npcs -> shows npc and timer
